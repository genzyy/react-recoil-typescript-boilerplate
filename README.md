## Routing

The routing is being handled with `react-router-dom`. There are mainly two types of routes, one of them is authenticated routes and the other ones are public which can be accessed by anyone.

## Styling

Sass is what is being used for all styling needs as it provides more flexibility and is better than css. It provides modular styling and so is being used in this project.
